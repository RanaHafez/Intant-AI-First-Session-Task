# 1) AI Solutions that are not data-driven

Artificial Intelligence can be defined as the ability of a computer or machine to mimic the intelligent behavior to perform tasks in a real environment. In order to use AI some argue that we must have data. But is it the case? The answer is No. AI comes in many ways and not all of them require data. There are 3 major approaches to AI: Data-driven, Knowledge-driven, and Problem-driven.  AI can be used in many ways that can be as simple as if-else statement but be very powerful
Here are some examples of AI projects that are not data required:

* Chess Player <br>
  AI Here AI is responsive with no past data it responds to stored rules and instructions. Fun Fact: The First computer to defeat a human in chess is called Deep Blue
* Personal Digital Assistants and other speech recognition systems such as Siri
* Rule-Based Systems which has many applications like spam filters or chatbots. These systems are designed to pull data from larger systems to deliver answers
* Online Game Playing
* humanoid robotics 
* NLP in which we encode the syntax of human languages into methods to interpret and produce language chatbots that can understand and respond to customer questions.
